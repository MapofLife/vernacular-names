   (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats)

 - Fixed an error that occurs when no changes need to be saved from 
   Bulk Import (/import)

0.9.1: June 15, 2015

 - Took out individual language codes and source priorities because it kept 
   hitting GAE memory limits.

0.9: June 15, 2015
 - Standardized print() and logging.info() to logging.debug().
 - Added ereporter support so that exceptions are e-mailed to me daily.

   Google App Engine modules.
 - Added documentation for the database schema.

0.8.2: June 4, 2015
 - Switched module to 'nomdb'.

0.8.1: June 1, 2015
 - Reorganized code into an nomdb package.
	- Configuration options and language settings moved into package.
	- Common methods not directly related to names collected in 'nomdb.common'
	- All code now uses Python-standard naming and (basic) method documentation.
 - Rewrote vnnames.py with a MUCH simpler, faster interface.
	- generate_tt.py rewritten to use new interface.
 - Old higher-taxonomy system partially deleted; remainder will be deleted as the new
   taxonomy system is incorporated.
 - Source priority limiting improved.

0.7: May 20, 2015
 - Ajay's style improvements.
 - Switched to use GAE's urlfetch if available, but fallback to the standard
   urlfetch package otherwise, which makes it easier to run it locally.
 - Renamed /genera to /family

0.6: January 7, 2015
 - Reworked higher taxonomy so that it comes directly from the Master List.
 - Modified bulk uploader to support inserting either the family common name 
   or a family common/genus name hybrid.

 - /list and /masterlist now have buttons to send the current list of names to
   the bulk import/editor.
