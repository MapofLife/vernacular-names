1. Used Ruby gem 'dbf' to convert dbf to csv.
2. Loaded CSVs into OpenRefine.
3. HTML-decoded all common names; any with '&' remaining (usually using obscure codes) deleted (~350 rows)
4. Deleted 115 "unknown" names
5. Deleted every row from a language with fewer than 15 rows: 435 rows

 -> result: 63,193 rows

6. Species links to genus links to family, which is as high as it goes, so I'm just going to ignore this.
7. I'm going to create entries from both the scname and acname (accepted name) for each common name.
8. Uploaded to the database.

 -> source: ARS GRIN taxonomy download on June 26, 2014
 -> URL: http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?$grin_taxon_id

9. Updated genus names:
	UPDATE entries SET genus = split_part(scname, ' ', 1) WHERE 
	genus IS NULL 
	AND split_part(scname, ' ', 2) != ''
	AND source = 'ARS GRIN taxonomy download on June 26, 2014';

10. Set up binomial:
	UPDATE entries SET binomial = split_part(scname, ' ', 1) || ' ' || split_part(scname, ' ', 2) WHERE source='ARS GRIN taxonomy download on June 26, 2014';
