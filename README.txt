A vernacular names framework for Map of Life
============================================

We need one place to put all the common names in a way that is easy 
to manipulate. We’re going to put it all into a single table with 
the following structure.

For now, I’m using the language ‘la’ to store the definitive list of
species currently in Map of Life; I’ll delete it once I have a better
way of storing lists in this system.
